# iSynopsis
A smart synopsis of all the information you receive from internet channels


This is my side project which I have been thinking for while. Basically the idea is there are so may channels through which you are constantly getting information for instance- facebook, twitter, emails etc. This information influx is so high that we can not cope up with all the information. **iSynopsis** will consume the information from these channel, filter and generate a smart summary based on your interest.
